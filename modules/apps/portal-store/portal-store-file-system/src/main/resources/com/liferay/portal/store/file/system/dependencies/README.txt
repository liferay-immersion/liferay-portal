This directory contains all files generated by Documents and Media and Adaptive
Media.

Note that all Adaptive Media content (which includes Documents and Media
previews and thumbnails) can be recreated from scratch with no data loss. For
this reason, you may omit any Adaptive Media generated content from your
backups, or you may remove those files in case of need (e.g. acute storage
shortage). These files will be regenerated on demand as users request them.

All Adaptive Media content will hang from directories named following the
pattern `/[0-9]+/0/adaptive` (e.g. `/20097/0/adaptive`). You can safely use this
pattern to exclude these files from your backups.

Removing (or failing to restore) any other file except Adaptive Media content is
not supported, and will produce failures in DXP. Please, make sure you only
exclude Adaptive Media content from your backups.
